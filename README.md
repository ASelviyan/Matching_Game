## **ELEVATOR PITCH**

It's DO or DIE!!!! You will have to match all the symbols on the board before the timer runs out! You can play by yourself trying to survive against the clock or against your worst enemy your friend!

## **TECH STACK**

- CSS
- JavaScript

![PlayerTwo](./img/two%20players.PNG)
![BOMB MODE](./img/BOMB%20MODE.PNG)

## **MVP Goals**

- Render a start screen with one mode "Player one"
- create a random generator that allows for randimization of the cards
- Make cards not visible until the player clicks on them
- if not a match flip the card so the text isnt seen
- when a card matched the cards need to stay flipped
- add a timer to the one player mode
- display text when time has run out and stop the game
- a restart button that restarts the game
- add instructions

## **STRETCH**

- the animation of the flip of a card
- cards ill change places every 3 turns of not matching
- Add Two Player mode
- add bomb mode that will give each player hearts and if they guess wrong or click on a bomb card they lose a life but if they guess right then they gain a heart

## **Post-Projects Thoughts**

- Didn't reach my stretch goals but will be working on them in the future.
- I had a lot of practice with the DOM and time function and I am more comfortable with using them.
