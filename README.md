## **MVP Goals**

- Render a start screen with one mode "Player one"
- create a random generator that allows for randimization of the cards
- Make cards not visible until the player clicks on them
- if not a match flip the card so the text isnt seen
- when a card matched the cards need to stay flipped
- add a timer to the one player mode
- display text when time has run out and stop the game
- a new game button/back button to go to the main screen
- instructions button that pulls up the instruction for each game

## **STRETCH**

- the animation of the flip of a card
- cards ill change places every 3 turns of not matching
- Add Two Player mode
- add bomb mode that will give each player hearts and if they guess wrong or click on a bomb card they lose a life but if they guess right then they gain a heart

## **ROADBLOCKS**
